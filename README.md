Online Web application WoodLands Away.


Woodlands Away are a new holiday company and they offer log cabin holidays in different parts of the UK. These holidays offer luxury lodges nestled deep in woodland across the Peak District and are a perfect retreat. There is a choice of three different cabins, luxury, contemporary and original. All have a lavish style and include hot tubs. The park has a number of features including a swimming pool, restaurant and small supermarket. There are 100s of acres of peaceful woodland to explore. Woodlands Away need a website to attract new customers and this needs to include an online booking system and details of the facilities at the park and the log cabins.

So I have produced a web-based application, which will enable customers to view the log cabins at the park and book online and have access to an online community forum, in which they will be able to ask questions and also answer questions from other customers. The owners have asked you to create a Booking System that allows visitors to create their own personal account. The system will store the personal details of each customer, their email address, postal address including postcode and gender so that appropriate marketing material can be sent in future. Different prices are charged during the busier summer months and each log cabin has a minimum price for at least 2 adults and 2 
children. Each cabin can be booked for a weekend for 4 days (Friday to Monday) or 5 days (Monday to Friday). Prices of each cabin type will be presented in local currency (pounds, euros and dollars). The system also needs to allow the owners to modify bookings. Seasonal discount tickets are available at various times of the year when visitor numbers are low and this should be incorporated into the system. Clients need to create their own account to log into the system. Once they log in they should be presented with an interface that allows them to:


 View the details of the three different cabin types – luxury, contemporary and original.
 Book a log cabin for either 4 days (weekend) or 5 days (midweek).
 View the prices in their local currency.
 Access the online community forum.
